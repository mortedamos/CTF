
Inspector,

You have now seen that my intentions are true and my wrath upon the 
impure sharp and true. The scum of old town have been purified, 
leaving only the pure and unviolated in my wake.

Did you enjoy our little game?

I played this, and while doing so, I pondered the hexagrams of 
the I-Ching. Some believe they can be used to divine the future. 
Cleromancy, they called it. A system - but a human system - to 
create numbers that could be used to predict the future. A 
humanly infinite number of combinations created from a limited 
number of hexagrams.

Of course, now the computers can predict anything. Measuring every 
detail of the now and removing any uncertainty of the future. All is 
known. All is predictable. 

Nothing is permitted - just allowed.

And yet here I am. A pure human. 

Unpredictable.

Perhaps you will be able to divine my next move?

You may hate me, my friend, but know that what I do is for the best 
and betterment of all pure humanity.


Inspector,

How glorious the past few days have been. 

Are you familiar with the Dictionnaire Infernal? It counts the demons 
of hell, each with their own favorite set of sins. Sixty five in all. 
Categorized, perfectly ordered, evil.

Of course, we cannot count Garuda, Vahana of Lord Vishnu.  
Hardly a demon. One too many in that list. He was a phoenix.

And like a phoenix, the pure human shall arise from the junk fused 
corpses of the old world. Discarded like so much metallic trash.

Do you know the final direction?

1. QR-KB6 NP-KN5
2. RP-KB6 RP-Q5
3. NP-KB5 QN-KN1
4. P-KB1 P-QB7
5. Q-QR7 QN-KB1 (QNxKN)
6. QR-KB7 P-QN6
7. K-QN5 QN-KN7 (QNxP)
8. NP-KB2 P-QN5

Take heed, inspector.

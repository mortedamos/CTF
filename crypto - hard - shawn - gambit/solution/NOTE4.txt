
Inspector,

The hour grows late, and im tired of waiting for you make the next 
move.

Do you know that gadolinium can be used to excise cancerous tumors 
using neutron therapy? 

Neutrons can remove cancer. Neutrons can remove the impure. 

The universe of full of symmetries, isn't it? A superperfect number.

Do you know where im heading with this?

I've perfected the EMP, after my little tests elsewhere in the city. 
The next time it will be much bigger. The next time the entire city 
will feel freedom from the burden of cybernetics, and the pure humans 
shall rise up and reclaim the earth. Reclaim our future. 

I myself am impure. Did you know this? My will is strong but my lungs 
are weak, damaged by the foul fumes of our fair city.

This is my final game. My last move.

Your computers cannot solve this, because it is a human game.

I shall await you, inspector, in the bliss of the analog afterlife.

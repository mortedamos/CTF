
Inspector,

Allow me to make introductions. I am the Commodore. I am here to 
cleanse the impure filth of cybernetics and cyber-reliance from 
our dear city. As raging fire of the atomic age gives way to the 
purity of electromagnetism, so too shall my EMP bomb show us the way 
to an time free of corruption and unnatural invasive metallic flesh.

We've lost something along the way. Philosophy. True Art. 

Even games.

Take chess, for example. Once considered a platform of infinite 
possibility, our computers have robbed us of enjoyment, predicting any 
and every possible move. The last great matches happened at the turn 
of the 20th century. After that the machines defeated us with ease.

We live in a world of the defeated. 

But I will fight back. I refuse to live in a world without achievement.

I will achieve. I will do something. I will return us to a world of 
goals and dreams and ghosts and blood and sweat.

I present the following, and invite you to predict my next move.

1. NP-Q6 Q-KN7
2. RP-QN2 P-K5
3. BP-QR7 QN-KB1
4. K-QN6 QB-KR6
5. QB-KB5 QN-KN7
6. KB-QR1 ?

Your dear friend,

	Commodore

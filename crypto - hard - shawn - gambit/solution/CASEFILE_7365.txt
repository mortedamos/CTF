Hello,

It's been a hard few weeks.

As you know several EMP weapons have been detonated within our city 
over the past few weeks damaging infrascture, wiping computer records, 
and causing havok for anything that needs a steady supply of power...
which is, well, everything - and any one, too. We've lost a few people 
as well because of fried cybernetics and damged life support.

What the rest of the world doesn't know, and bear in mind that this is 
highly confidential information, that these weapons were planted by a 
terrorist who calls himself Commodore. Shortly before the detonation 
of each EMP he sends us a message - some inane ramblings - but he 
seems preoccupied with chess.

That is why you are here.

You've come highly reccomended for this matter - but I know that this 
isn't your usual deal. Terrorism is a far cry from your usual chess 
matches and hacker competitions. But the pressure is on and, quite 
frankly, we don't have anyone else to turn to. 

I've enclosed the notes we have received from this madman. Each note 
preceeded detonation at a particular location. 

	Note 1 - Old Town
	Note 2 - Chiba District
	Note 3 - Vector Sigma

The last note? We don't know where that is going to happen. It came in 
a few hours ago, and the clock it ticking. Crack the code. Find out 
where the next EMP will go off. Help us save our city.

Sincerely,

	Inspector Altair
	2nd Adjunct of Policy Node 17
